# LetsEncrypt_Serverlist
LetsEncrypt does NOT recommend to use a list of their servers, but in some cases it could be useful to whitelist the servers used by LE.
This list is updated from time to time.
It is very probable that LE will change some of their servers and this is not reflected in this list asap....

In addition you'll find the FQDN-List. These servers are often used to start a verification process and should also be whitelisted.
